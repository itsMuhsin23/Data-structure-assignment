        Sparse Matrix Transformation
Sparse matrix is the process of applying  mathematical operations to a matrix that contains mostly zero elements.

A matrix is sparse if:

- The majority of its elements are zero

- Only a relatively small number of entries are non-zero

These transformations may include changing the matrix representation (such as converting a dense matrix into a sparse format), 
transposing the matrix, performing linear operations like scaling or matrix multiplication, 
or reordering rows and columns to optimize performance. By ignoring zero entries during computation, 
sparse matrix transformations enable efficient handling of large-scale matrices that would otherwise be impractical to process.


sparse matrix has lesser memory since it has lesser non-zero elements.

Time complexity is O(m * n)
