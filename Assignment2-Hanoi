           Towers Of Hanoi

 The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle used in computer science, mathematics,
and problem-solving contexts.

Tower of Hanoi is a puzzle where disks are moved between pegs under specific rules,
often used to teach recursion and algorithmic thinking.


#include <stdio.h>


void towerOfHanoi(int n, char source, char destination, char auxiliary) {
    if (n == 1) {
        printf("Move disk 1 from %c to %c\n", source, destination);
        return;
    }
    
    towerOfHanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, destination);
    
    
    printf("Move disk %d from %c to %c\n", n, source, destination);
    

    towerOfHanoi(n-1, auxiliary, destination, source);
}

int main() {
    int n = 3; 
    printf("Tower of Hanoi with %d disks:\n", n);
    towerOfHanoi(n, 'A', 'C', 'B'); // 
    return 0;
}
