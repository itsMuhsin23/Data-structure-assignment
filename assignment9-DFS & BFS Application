                   DFS & BFS Application


   DFS Application:
1. Finding Connected Components (Clusters)
2. Cycle Detection - detects cycles in directed and undirected graphs
3. Topological Sorting - orders tasks based on dependencies
4. Path Finding and maze solving - explores all possible paths
5. Tree traversals - inorder,preorder, postorder traversals
6. Artificial Intelligence - used in game trees.


  BFS Application:
1. Shortest Path in Unweighted Graphs - find the shortest number of edges
2. Level Order Traversal of Trees  - traverses tree level by level
3. Bipartite Graph Checking - determine whether graph can be divided into two sets
4. Web Crawlers - Crawls web pages level by level
5. Broadcasting in Networks - used in packet routing for communication
6. Shortest Path in Grids and Mazes - for robot navigation
